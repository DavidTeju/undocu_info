This is to help connect them with a counselor who has a stronger background on immigration concerns, but they are admitted as a \u201cdomestic\u201d student for the purposes of application review.","are you need-blind for undocumented students?":"We don\u2019t admissions decisions based off of economic\/financial situations. Our admissions is more based off of academic history.","are there any restrictions on merit aid for undocumented students at your school?":"All students are eligible for FSC\u2019s standard merit scholarships regardless of documentation status. There are a few specific scholarships that have a citizenship requirement, but most of FSC\u2019s merit aid will not factor status into the scholarship award.","does your school provide merit aid specially for undocumented students?":"No but our academic merit aid is offered to all students regardless of citizenship status.","would you advise an undocumented student to reveal their status in their application or subsequent email?":null,"how would their status affect their application?":null,"is there a special contact point for undocumented students?":"You would use the international admissions counselors.","what other piece of advice would you give an undocumented student hoping for admission at your school?":null,"other admissions information":"Yes - please contact us so that we can help direct you to resources and ensure that we\u2019re giving you accurate information.

If you are uncomfortable disclosing your status in your application, you\u2019re welcome to call us.","are undocumented students eligible for need-based aid?":"Yes, on a case-by-case basis. They are not eligible for federal student aid by federal policy, but they can still submit the FAFSA for us to potentially award institutional need-based aid. FSC does not currently offer full need.","what financial aid application should undocumented students send? the css, fafsa, isfaa or a form unique to your school?":null,"if need-based aid is not available, is there a feasible path undocumented students can take to pay for their education with stackable merit scholarships, loans and\/or grants from your school?":"All merit scholarships are stackable at FSC, but most students will not receive aid that completely covers the cost of attendance and would need to seek out private loans or outside scholarships to cover full cost if their families can\u2019t pay out of pocket. The average financial aid award at FSC covers approximately half of the cost of attendance (tuition, room, meals and medical insurance). FSC does not work directly with any loans besides the Federal Direct and Parent PLUS loans, which undocumented students are generally not eligible to take.","what would be the requirements for such scholarships and what would a student's chances of getting them?":"Merit scholarships are determined based on academic record and most students are awarded a scholarship at time of admission. The Prestige and Premier Scholarships typically have rough GPA and SAT\/ACT scores as a guideline, but were test-optional last year. The Prestige and Premier Scholarships typically receive about 500 applications, interview around 120 students, and award 8 to 10 Hollingsworth Scholarships (full-ride\/full-cost) or McClurg Scholarships (full tuition). Other applicants and interviewees may receive Christoverson Scholarships of varying amounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn example of a student with stacked scholarships:\r\n\r\nHigh academic achieving, graphic design, swimmer:\r\n\r\nThis student received a merit based, christoverson (prestige), talent scholarship (graphic design) and swim scholarship for athletics.","other financial aid information":"FAFSA.

However, we are a private institution so we don\u2019t get as many as a public school where some of those students may be offered in state tuition.","does your school allow immigration and customs enforcement (ice) officers onto campus without a warrant?":"I have never witnessed this happened in my time as an admissions counselor. I took this from ACLU:\r\n\u201cICE and CBP maintain a policy which provides that they will not engage in immigration enforcement in sensitive locations like schools absent prior approval by a supervisor or exigent circumstances. This policy has recently been reaffirmed by the Department of Homeland Security. This means that ICE and CBP generally will not arrest, interview, search, or surveil a person for immigration enforcement purposes while at a school, a known school bus stop, or an educational activity.\u201d","does the campus police enforce immigration law?":"That is not their primary focus. Their focus is campus safety. I will say that the FSC police on our campus are part of the Lakeland Police and because of this, they would have to enforce their laws if the situation arises, but again, this is not their focus while on campus.","does your school share student immigration status with ice?":"We do not have to share this information. We only share the F-1 student visa information to them.","does your school provide distance-learning options for deported students to complete their degrees?":"Fundamentally, FSC is an in-person institution and does not offer much in the way of fully remote coursework for undergraduate programs. This would be handled on a case-by-case basis and would likely depend on the individual student\u2019s particular situation.","does your school provide confidential legal support to students with immigration law questions and issues?":"No - while FSC may be able to help direct students to outside legal counsel on a case-by-case basis, FSC does not retain an immigration lawyer on staff.","other student life information":null,"has undocu-student webpage":null,"other information":null,"special contact":null,"gives aid?":1.0},"Florida State University":{"email":["admissions@fsu.edu"],"domain":"fsu","state":null,"are undocumented students considered international or domestic?":null,"are you need-blind for undocumented students?":null,"are there any restrictions on merit aid for undocumented students at your school?":null,"does your school provide merit aid specially for undocumented students?":null,"would you advise an undocumented student to reveal their status in their application or subsequent email?":null,"how would their status affect their application?":null,"is there a special contact point for undocumented students?":null,"what other piece of advice would you give an undocumented student hoping for admission at your school?":null,"other admissions information":null,"are undocumented students eligible for need-based aid?":null,"what financial aid application should undocumented students send?

Applicants should be directed to contact our office as each applicant is responsible to provide the required material.","special contact":null,"gives aid?":0.0},"Michigan Technological University":{"email":["mtu4u@mtu.edu"],"domain":"mtu","state":null,"are undocumented students considered international or domestic?":null,"are you need-blind for undocumented students?":null,"are there any restrictions on merit aid for undocumented students at your school?":null,"does your school provide merit aid specially for undocumented students?":null,"would you advise an undocumented student to reveal their status in their application or subsequent email?":null,"how would their status affect their application?":null,"is there a special contact point for undocumented students?":null,"what other piece of advice would you give an undocumented student hoping for admission at your school?":null,"other admissions information":null,"are undocumented students eligible for need-based aid?":null,"what financial aid application should undocumented students send?

The Sagehen network is for current students, alumni and their immediate family members.\r\n\r\nCurrent students may also contact the Sagehen network to arrange a consultation with a lawyer regarding legal representation resources in case of detention (including a signed G28 form).\r\n\r\nEmergency Grants\r\nStudents may request funding related to immigration-related costs. Students may also apply for emergency funding for immigration-related fees for them, parents or close family members.\r\n\r\nThe College may provide up to $1,000 in legal support for immigration-related cases. These requests are reviewed with our alumni lawyers who are part of a pro bono legal resource network for students, alumni, as well as students who are citizens or legal permanent residents but whose parents or siblings are undocumented.\r\n\r\nOn-Campus Resources\r\nA variety of resources are available to undocumented and DACAmented students who need support:\r\n\r\nStaff Support\r\nStudent affairs staff provide support for undocumented students.

Through the programs, resources and services, the CDO strives to inspire, educate, and equip Sagehens for a purposeful and rewarding life.  The CDO offers three distinguished programs: The Pomona College Internship Program (PCIP Semester), Summer Experience (PCIP Summer Experience) and Campus Fellowships for Experiential Learning. These programs aid students in the process of exploring & determining a career path, gaining a rich understanding of a particular field and\/or organization, building & growing their professional networks, and enhancing the understanding of how their liberal arts education will be applied in a professional work environment\r\n\r\nStudents may request funding through the Office of Financial Aid to replace a reasonable amount of the expected work study funding and\/or the student contribution if a student is not able to work due to an expiring DACA work authorization or other extenuating circumstances.

Since we do not track undocumented students, we have not datas related to whether or not they are engaged with any student groups or clubs, including those that advocate for students.  Our institution has groups that engage in student advocacy.  They may or may not decided to advocate for undocumented students.  While we do not have the document on hand, approximately 8-10 years ago, the undergraduate student government passed a resolution in support of undocumented students.  For more information, please write directly to the Associated Students of the University of Hawaii at Manoa at asuh@hawaii.edu.  I could not locate the resolution from what they currently have posted on their website.  If the document is desired, it would need to be requested and pulled from their archives.","how often does your office receive applications from undocumented students?":null,"does your school allow immigration and customs enforcement (ice) officers onto campus without a warrant?":null,"does the campus police enforce immigration law?":null,"does your school share student immigration status with ice?":null,"does your school provide distance-learning options for deported students to complete their degrees?":null,"does your school provide confidential legal support to students with immigration law questions and issues?":null,"other student life information":null,"has undocu-student webpage":null,"other information":null,"special contact":null,"gives aid?":0.0},"University Of Hawaii At Manoa":{"email":["manoa.admissions@hawaii.edu"],"domain":"hawaii","state":null,"are undocumented students considered international or domestic?":null,"are you need-blind for undocumented students?":null,"are there any restrictions on merit aid for undocumented students at your school?":null,"does your school provide merit aid specially for undocumented students?":null,"would you advise an undocumented student to reveal their status in their application or subsequent email?":null,"how would their status affect their application?":null,"is there a special contact point for undocumented students?":null,"what other piece of advice would you give an undocumented student hoping for admission at your school?":null,"other admissions information":null,"are undocumented students eligible for need-based aid?":null,"what financial aid application should undocumented students send?

The questions are in different areas, such as Admissions, International Programs, Financial Aid, Student Life, Title IX, Housing and Campus Police. I can totally relate to complexities of the application process for U.S. colleges\/ Universities as I was or still am an International student myself. I was 16 when I started the research on universities, the admissions, financial aid, and lot similar questions which you are asking below. Coming from a different academic background, all the information was a puzzle to me.\r\n\r\nWhat we can do is, we can arrange a virtual meeting for you and possibly a workshop to assist you how to complete the application, how apply for TAFSA, Financial Aid and grants as well as answer all of your questions which you stated below. We can answer yours, your family\u2019s questions in English, Spanish or both or check if we can host in other languages. We can arrange this meeting in less than 24 hours or the virtual meeting can be on the same day.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely easy to answer your questions in an email. It will be a long email with multiple pages and paragraphs. Reading the answers in an email and reading the information on a website is the same. Some questions cannot be answered in one sentence with a bullet point. UHV strives in providing one-on-one attention to all of our students. This is why UHV is unique and why students selects UHV. Meeting and talking to you will give us an opportunity to meet with you and help you to navigate the complex application and possibly connect you with other DACA\/ Undocumented students (with their permission) for you to ask questions yourself and build a network prior to enrolling at UHV. You can visit our Virtual Lobby online or schedule a virtual meeting, all you have to do is follow the links mentioned. If you wish to talk to an official at each of the departments which I mentioned above then let me know few dates\/ and times and I can coordinate the meeting (herathl@uhv.edu). You may have many friends who are also DACA\/ Undocumented students. You are welcome to invite your friends who are DACA\/ Undocumented, parents and families and we can host a workshop either virtually or face-2-face. We can host the meeting in English, Spanish or both. If there are other language preferences we can check if we have faculty members to assist with other languages. We have faculty and students from Bangladesh, China, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Sierra Leon, Kenya, Japan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and many more. Before COVID, International Programs and UHV Admissions hosted numerous workshops for DACA\/ Undocumented students and their families as well as mentored undocumented students for work related experience or in other words job shadow experience.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to complete your research among other Texas institutions as well as out-of-state institutions to get a comprehensive knowledge of how the application, financial aid and student life works at U.S. colleges and institutions as well as to check the best package you can receive for your academic, and professional credentials to pursue your academic endeavors.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to hearing from you. Please follow the link mentioned below to visit the Virtual Zoom Lobby or to schedule a virtual or face-2-face meeting or let me know (herathl@uhv.edu) a few dates\/ and times and I can schedule a meeting with other staff members for you get all of your questions answered the same time.\r\n\r\nThe International Virtual Lobby (https:\/\/uhv.zoom.us\/j\/99837658466) is open Monday to Friday between 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time.

When reviewing applications for admission, we do review need-blind.\r\n\r\nWe understand that students travel many different roads to get to Carolina, and we celebrate the variety of interests, backgrounds, and aspirations that they bring with them. At the same time, it's fair to say that we seek excellence. We focus first on academic excellence, using a variety of information-courses, grades, test scores, recommendations, essays-to help us assess performance and potential. Because of the holistic nature of our review, there is no formula for admission--no one is automatically admitted or denied because of a single number or factor. We read applications in a thoughtful manner, as we work to understand each student individually. In seeking students who will contribute to our community and benefit from the Carolina experience, we need to know much more than just grades or test scores.\r\n\r\nWe're committed to a safe and welcoming environment for students and we want to see students thrive and complete their education at Carolina.","are undocumented students eligible for need-based aid?":null,"what financial aid application should undocumented students send? the css, fafsa, isfaa or a form unique to your school?":null,"if need-based aid is not available, is there a feasible path undocumented students can take to pay for their education with stackable merit scholarships, loans and\/or grants from your school?":null,"what would be the requirements for such scholarships and what would a student's chances of getting them?":null,"other financial aid information":"We are committed to access and affordability for all of our students and our tuition and fees are among the lowest in the nation.

You can learn more at www.wku.edu\/border. This is guaranteed to any student accepted to WKU regardless of documentation status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUndocumented students apply as domestic students at WKU. We will never share their information with ICE or any immigration officials and they are not allowed on campus without a warrant. Students should answer directly on the application that they are undocumented, however it will not affect their application process at all. As long as an undocumented students meets our admission requirements they will be admitted to WKU. Students are admitted to WKU with at least a 2.5 unweighted GPA (no ACT is required for admission). If the student is between a 2.0-2.49 unweighted GPA they can be admitted but at that point their ACT score would determine their admission eligibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUndocumented students are eligible for our merit scholarships here at WKU. You can view a list of our merit opportunities at https:\/\/www.wku.edu\/financialaid\/scholarships\/freshmen-2122-academicyear.php. There are no applications for the scholarships on that page (except the Cherry Presidential) and they will be applied to the students account automatically as long as they meet the minimum requirements for the awards. They are renewable and stackable. We also have a minority scholarship called the Cornelius A Martin Award that the majority of undocumented students that I work with receive. Any other questions regarding financial aid at WKU should be directed to their office at fa.help@wku.edu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI work with undocumented quite regularly and many of those students choose to enroll at WKU for our campus community. We are a mid-sized institution that prides itself on the strong relationships between our faculty and students. They truly go above and beyond to help our students succeed, and as an institution we provide every resource possible to ensure that our students achieve their academic, career, and personal goals. WKU is located in Bowling Green which was voted the best city to live in Kentucky as well as a top college town in America. WKU is proud of our diverse student body, and our Intercultural Student Engagement Center works directly with any underrepresented student to provide them with additional academic, social, and professional support.

Regardless of immigration status, we want all applicants to know that you are welcome here. You and your family are welcome to become an integral part of the DigiPen Dragon community.

Generally, DACA and other undocumented students are not eligible for federal, state, or institutional need-based financial aid due to eligibility criteria that requires either U.S. citizenship or other eligible noncitizen status (e.g., permanent residents of the U.S.) and/or the submission of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). DACA students are not eligible to complete the FAFSA due to these federal regulations.

Due to the complexity and uncertainty (e.g., potential changes in admission criteria) caused by the global pandemic, you are strongly encouraged to apply to DigiPen and send required documents to us first. Once you have decided to apply to DigiPen, we can discuss further via Zoom, phone, or in person.

The College may provide up to $1,000 in legal support for immigration-related cases.

More information on the international student application process may be found at: https://admissions.unc.edu/apply/international-students/. When reviewing applications for admission, we do review need-blind.

We understand that students travel many different roads to get to Carolina, and we celebrate the variety of interests, backgrounds, and aspirations that they bring with them. At the same time, it's fair to say that we seek excellence. We focus first on academic excellence, using a variety of information-courses, grades, test scores, recommendations, essays-to help us assess performance and potential. Because of the holistic nature of our review, there is no formula for admission--no one is automatically admitted or denied because of a single number or factor. We read applications in a thoughtful manner, as we work to understand each student individually. In seeking students who will contribute to our community and benefit from the Carolina experience, we need to know much more than just grades or test scores.

We're committed to a safe and welcoming environment for students and we want to see students thrive and complete their education at Carolina.",,,,,"We are committed to access and affordability for all of our students and our tuition and fees are among the lowest in the nation.

We are able to consider international students for a very limited number of scholarships.

More information about the financial aid process for international students may found here https://studentaid.unc.edu/special-circumstances/international-students/.",,,,,,,,,,Thank you for your interest in learning more about Carolina.

If the student is between a 2.0-2.49 unweighted GPA they can be admitted but at that point their ACT score would determine their admission eligibility.



Undocumented students are eligible for our merit scholarships here at WKU.

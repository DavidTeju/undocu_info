The student will just need to submit transcripts and an immunization record. Once the student is accepted, they can freely take classes.",,,,,"Regarding Financial Aid- Unfortunately, undocumented students are not eligible for any federal funding as you need a SSN number to apply for FAFSA. FAFSA is what allows all schools in the country to verify a student's financial aid eligibility. Each school may have independent help in regards to offering students additional aid that does not fall under federal funding. At Dalton State, we have the Dalton State Foundation Scholarship. These are scholarships that all Dalton State students can apply for regardless of residency. The scholarships within the foundation have various requirements based on different things like GPA, major, and demographical information. Undocumented students do have to pay the out-of-state tuition rate as there is no way to verify residency for in-state tuition.

You can read more about our suggested high school curriculum online: https://uadmissions.georgetown.edu/applying/preparation-process/. We generally look for students who are competitive in their classes and excel in those upper-level courses but will evaluate a student based on all aspects of their application. For statistics on the average scores of our admitted students please review the student profile here: https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/z4tgwmps28jo4hd83i1migipgjw43uuo. We strongly recommend you also review our preparation process page (https://uadmissions.georgetown.edu/applying/preparation-process/) and general information page (https://uadmissions.georgetown.edu/applying/first-year/) for more details on how to prepare to apply to Georgetown University. We have specific information about applying as an international applicant here: https://uadmissions.georgetown.edu/applying/international/.

We would recommend that you contact them via their suggested methods posted on their website and if need, contact them via email at finfront@georgetown.edu.

Current Pomona students and alumni may contact the Sagehen Pro Bono immigration legal resources network (primarily composed of alumni) via email at any time for immigration issues or concerns that may arise. The Sagehen network is for current students, alumni and their immediate family members.

Current students may also contact the Sagehen network to arrange a consultation with a lawyer regarding legal representation resources in case of detention (including a signed G28 form).

Emergency Grants
Students may request funding related to immigration-related costs. Students may also apply for emergency funding for immigration-related fees for them, parents or close family members.

The College may provide up to $1,000 in legal support for immigration-related cases. These requests are reviewed with our alumni lawyers who are part of a pro bono legal resource network for students, alumni, as well as students who are citizens or legal permanent residents but whose parents or siblings are undocumented.

On-Campus Resources
A variety of resources are available to undocumented and DACAmented students who need support:

Staff Support
Student affairs staff provide support for undocumented students. In the Office of Student Leadership and Mentoring, Daniel Caballero serves as Assistant Director, First-Generation & Undocumented Student Programs and works closely with the IDEAS (Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success) Club of The Claremont Colleges as well as the Pomona IDEAS mentoring program for undocumented students and FLI (First-Generation, Low-Income Scholars Mentorship). Dean Ric Townes oversees the student leadership and mentoring program. Associate Dean of Students and Director of the Draper Center for Community Partnerships Sefa Aina. Draper Center Assistant Director, Stephanie Rios. and Associate Dean of Students and Director of the Asian American Resource Center Mike Manalo-Pedro provide additional program support.

Student Groups
Student-led groups such as IDEAS offer cross campus support for undocumented students and allies. The Pomona IDEAS peer mentoring program provides personalized support for undocumented students in their transition to Pomona.

Counseling Services
To supplement the resources of Monsour Counseling Center, the Dean of Students Office also offers access to therapists off campus with whom the office and Monsour counseling have developed local partnerships, including therapists with expertise in working with undocumented students. On-campus as well as off-site counseling services are available for all students. Students can email wellness@pomona.edu  to find out more. Monsour counseling is also open for counseling appointments, and encourages students to contact them at (909) 621-8202 if they need to see a counselor immediately. Students can also contact the on-call dean 24/7 via Campus Safety (909-607-2000).

Career Development and Post-graduation Support
The Career Development Office (CDO) empowers students and alumni to utilize their liberal arts education to gain self-understanding, identify their interests, and formulate a career plan.  Through the programs, resources and services, the CDO strives to inspire, educate, and equip Sagehens for a purposeful and rewarding life.  The CDO offers three distinguished programs: The Pomona College Internship Program (PCIP Semester), Summer Experience (PCIP Summer Experience) and Campus Fellowships for Experiential Learning. These programs aid students in the process of exploring & determining a career path, gaining a rich understanding of a particular field and/or organization, building & growing their professional networks, and enhancing the understanding of how their liberal arts education will be applied in a professional work environment

Students may request funding through the Office of Financial Aid to replace a reasonable amount of the expected work study funding and/or the student contribution if a student is not able to work due to an expiring DACA work authorization or other extenuating circumstances. Students may submit the Work-Study Replacement Request [pdf] form to the Office of Financial Aid. We also welcome students to meet with their financial aid counselor at any time if they encounter financial challenges or if there are changing financial circumstances at home.

Undocumented students who have been granted DACA status at the time of admission and undocumented students who do not hold DACA status but have or will graduate from a U.S. high school and who have lived in the U.S. for an extended period of time are considered domestic students. For domestic students, Rice University practices need-blind admissions and meets the full demonstrated financial need of admitted students through a combination of scholarship awards, work study and available loans.
We have some well developed resources for DACA and Undocumented Students on our website - much of the information is in bullet form, so hopefully you can find whatever information you are looking for:

We are here for you and more than happy to help in any way possible. We are part of your support system!

The questions are in different areas, such as Admissions, International Programs, Financial Aid, Student Life, Title IX, Housing and Campus Police. I can totally relate to complexities of the application process for U.S. colleges/ Universities as I was or still am an International student myself. I was 16 when I started the research on universities, the admissions, financial aid, and lot similar questions which you are asking below. Coming from a different academic background, all the information was a puzzle to me.

What we can do is, we can arrange a virtual meeting for you and possibly a workshop to assist you how to complete the application, how apply for TAFSA, Financial Aid and grants as well as answer all of your questions which you stated below. We can answer yours, your family’s questions in English, Spanish or both or check if we can host in other languages. We can arrange this meeting in less than 24 hours or the virtual meeting can be on the same day.

It is absolutely easy to answer your questions in an email. It will be a long email with multiple pages and paragraphs. Reading the answers in an email and reading the information on a website is the same. Some questions cannot be answered in one sentence with a bullet point. UHV strives in providing one-on-one attention to all of our students. This is why UHV is unique and why students selects UHV. Meeting and talking to you will give us an opportunity to meet with you and help you to navigate the complex application and possibly connect you with other DACA/ Undocumented students (with their permission) for you to ask questions yourself and build a network prior to enrolling at UHV. You can visit our Virtual Lobby online or schedule a virtual meeting, all you have to do is follow the links mentioned. If you wish to talk to an official at each of the departments which I mentioned above then let me know few dates/ and times and I can coordinate the meeting (herathl@uhv.edu). You may have many friends who are also DACA/ Undocumented students. You are welcome to invite your friends who are DACA/ Undocumented, parents and families and we can host a workshop either virtually or face-2-face. We can host the meeting in English, Spanish or both. If there are other language preferences we can check if we have faculty members to assist with other languages. We have faculty and students from Bangladesh, China, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Sierra Leon, Kenya, Japan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and many more. Before COVID, International Programs and UHV Admissions hosted numerous workshops for DACA/ Undocumented students and their families as well as mentored undocumented students for work related experience or in other words job shadow experience.

I encourage you to complete your research among other Texas institutions as well as out-of-state institutions to get a comprehensive knowledge of how the application, financial aid and student life works at U.S. colleges and institutions as well as to check the best package you can receive for your academic, and professional credentials to pursue your academic endeavors.

I am looking forward to hearing from you. Please follow the link mentioned below to visit the Virtual Zoom Lobby or to schedule a virtual or face-2-face meeting or let me know (herathl@uhv.edu) a few dates/ and times and I can schedule a meeting with other staff members for you get all of your questions answered the same time.

Students who do not hold U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status would be considered international students at Carolina. More information on the international student application process may be found at: https://admissions.unc.edu/apply/international-students/. When reviewing applications for admission, we do review need-blind.

We understand that students travel many different roads to get to Carolina, and we celebrate the variety of interests, backgrounds, and aspirations that they bring with them. At the same time, it's fair to say that we seek excellence. We focus first on academic excellence, using a variety of information-courses, grades, test scores, recommendations, essays-to help us assess performance and potential. Because of the holistic nature of our review, there is no formula for admission--no one is automatically admitted or denied because of a single number or factor. We read applications in a thoughtful manner, as we work to understand each student individually. In seeking students who will contribute to our community and benefit from the Carolina experience, we need to know much more than just grades or test scores.

We're committed to a safe and welcoming environment for students and we want to see students thrive and complete their education at Carolina.",,,,,"We are committed to access and affordability for all of our students and our tuition and fees are among the lowest in the nation. International students (those who do not hold US citizenship or permanent resident status) should understand, however, that they are not eligible to receive need-based financial aid and should be prepared to pay the full cost of attendance. We are able to consider international students for a very limited number of scholarships. There is no separate application for these scholarships as students are automatically considered when they apply. More information about the financial aid process for international students may found here https://studentaid.unc.edu/special-circumstances/international-students/.",,,,,,,,,,Thank you for your interest in learning more about Carolina. We know that students manage a lot of nuance and detail as they're applying to colleges and we want to be a resource that helps make the process more approachable. We welcome and encourage students to reach out to us directly so we can help with their specific questions. Anyone on our team would be able to speak with students and families about the admissions process by phone or email at 919-966-3621 or unchelp@admissions.unc.edu.,,0.0

You can learn more at www.wku.edu/border. This is guaranteed to any student accepted to WKU regardless of documentation status.



Undocumented students apply as domestic students at WKU. We will never share their information with ICE or any immigration officials and they are not allowed on campus without a warrant. Students should answer directly on the application that they are undocumented, however it will not affect their application process at all. As long as an undocumented students meets our admission requirements they will be admitted to WKU. Students are admitted to WKU with at least a 2.5 unweighted GPA (no ACT is required for admission). If the student is between a 2.0-2.49 unweighted GPA they can be admitted but at that point their ACT score would determine their admission eligibility.



Undocumented students are eligible for our merit scholarships here at WKU. You can view a list of our merit opportunities at https://www.wku.edu/financialaid/scholarships/freshmen-2122-academicyear.php. There are no applications for the scholarships on that page (except the Cherry Presidential) and they will be applied to the students account automatically as long as they meet the minimum requirements for the awards. They are renewable and stackable. We also have a minority scholarship called the Cornelius A Martin Award that the majority of undocumented students that I work with receive. Any other questions regarding financial aid at WKU should be directed to their office at fa.help@wku.edu.



I work with undocumented quite regularly and many of those students choose to enroll at WKU for our campus community. We are a mid-sized institution that prides itself on the strong relationships between our faculty and students. They truly go above and beyond to help our students succeed, and as an institution we provide every resource possible to ensure that our students achieve their academic, career, and personal goals. WKU is located in Bowling Green which was voted the best city to live in Kentucky as well as a top college town in America. WKU is proud of our diverse student body, and our Intercultural Student Engagement Center works directly with any underrepresented student to provide them with additional academic, social, and professional support.

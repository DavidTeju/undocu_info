These are scholarships that all Dalton State students can apply for regardless of residency. The scholarships within the foundation have various requirements based on different things like GPA, major, and demographical information. Undocumented students do have to pay the out-of-state tuition rate as there is no way to verify residency for in-state tuition.

Generally, DACA and other undocumented students are not eligible for federal, state, or institutional need-based financial aid due to eligibility criteria that requires either U.S. citizenship or other eligible noncitizen status (e.g., permanent residents of the U.S.) and/or the submission of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). DACA students are not eligible to complete the FAFSA due to these federal regulations.

Due to the complexity and uncertainty (e.g., potential changes in admission criteria) caused by the global pandemic, you are strongly encouraged to apply to DigiPen and send required documents to us first. Once you have decided to apply to DigiPen, we can discuss further via Zoom, phone, or in person. As a reminder, you can submit your online application via https://management.digipen.edu/srs-app/applicationmenu.aspx.",,0.0

FSC does not currently offer full need.",,"All merit scholarships are stackable at FSC, but most students will not receive aid that completely covers the cost of attendance and would need to seek out private loans or outside scholarships to cover full cost if their families can’t pay out of pocket. The average financial aid award at FSC covers approximately half of the cost of attendance (tuition, room, meals and medical insurance). FSC does not work directly with any loans besides the Federal Direct and Parent PLUS loans, which undocumented students are generally not eligible to take.","Merit scholarships are determined based on academic record and most students are awarded a scholarship at time of admission. The Prestige and Premier Scholarships typically have rough GPA and SAT/ACT scores as a guideline, but were test-optional last year. The Prestige and Premier Scholarships typically receive about 500 applications, interview around 120 students, and award 8 to 10 Hollingsworth Scholarships (full-ride/full-cost) or McClurg Scholarships (full tuition). Other applicants and interviewees may receive Christoverson Scholarships of varying amounts.

However, we are a private institution so we don’t get as many as a public school where some of those students may be offered in state tuition.","I have never witnessed this happened in my time as an admissions counselor. I took this from ACLU:
“ICE and CBP maintain a policy which provides that they will not engage in immigration enforcement in sensitive locations like schools absent prior approval by a supervisor or exigent circumstances. This policy has recently been reaffirmed by the Department of Homeland Security. This means that ICE and CBP generally will not arrest, interview, search, or surveil a person for immigration enforcement purposes while at a school, a known school bus stop, or an educational activity.”","That is not their primary focus. Their focus is campus safety. I will say that the FSC police on our campus are part of the Lakeland Police and because of this, they would have to enforce their laws if the situation arises, but again, this is not their focus while on campus.",We do not have to share this information.

For more information regarding admissions, please email admissions@pomona.edu.

For questions about financial aid, please contact the Office of Financial Aid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Legal Resources
Current Pomona students and alumni may contact the Sagehen Pro Bono immigration legal resources network (primarily composed of alumni) via email at any time for immigration issues or concerns that may arise. The Sagehen network is for current students, alumni and their immediate family members.

Current students may also contact the Sagehen network to arrange a consultation with a lawyer regarding legal representation resources in case of detention (including a signed G28 form).

Emergency Grants
Students may request funding related to immigration-related costs. Students may also apply for emergency funding for immigration-related fees for them, parents or close family members.

The College may provide up to $1,000 in legal support for immigration-related cases. These requests are reviewed with our alumni lawyers who are part of a pro bono legal resource network for students, alumni, as well as students who are citizens or legal permanent residents but whose parents or siblings are undocumented.

On-Campus Resources
A variety of resources are available to undocumented and DACAmented students who need support:

Staff Support
Student affairs staff provide support for undocumented students. In the Office of Student Leadership and Mentoring, Daniel Caballero serves as Assistant Director, First-Generation & Undocumented Student Programs and works closely with the IDEAS (Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success) Club of The Claremont Colleges as well as the Pomona IDEAS mentoring program for undocumented students and FLI (First-Generation, Low-Income Scholars Mentorship). Dean Ric Townes oversees the student leadership and mentoring program. Associate Dean of Students and Director of the Draper Center for Community Partnerships Sefa Aina. Draper Center Assistant Director, Stephanie Rios. and Associate Dean of Students and Director of the Asian American Resource Center Mike Manalo-Pedro provide additional program support.

Student Groups
Student-led groups such as IDEAS offer cross campus support for undocumented students and allies. The Pomona IDEAS peer mentoring program provides personalized support for undocumented students in their transition to Pomona.

Counseling Services
To supplement the resources of Monsour Counseling Center, the Dean of Students Office also offers access to therapists off campus with whom the office and Monsour counseling have developed local partnerships, including therapists with expertise in working with undocumented students. On-campus as well as off-site counseling services are available for all students. Students can email wellness@pomona.edu  to find out more. Monsour counseling is also open for counseling appointments, and encourages students to contact them at (909) 621-8202 if they need to see a counselor immediately. Students can also contact the on-call dean 24/7 via Campus Safety (909-607-2000).

Career Development and Post-graduation Support
The Career Development Office (CDO) empowers students and alumni to utilize their liberal arts education to gain self-understanding, identify their interests, and formulate a career plan.  Through the programs, resources and services, the CDO strives to inspire, educate, and equip Sagehens for a purposeful and rewarding life.  The CDO offers three distinguished programs: The Pomona College Internship Program (PCIP Semester), Summer Experience (PCIP Summer Experience) and Campus Fellowships for Experiential Learning. These programs aid students in the process of exploring & determining a career path, gaining a rich understanding of a particular field and/or organization, building & growing their professional networks, and enhancing the understanding of how their liberal arts education will be applied in a professional work environment

Students may request funding through the Office of Financial Aid to replace a reasonable amount of the expected work study funding and/or the student contribution if a student is not able to work due to an expiring DACA work authorization or other extenuating circumstances. Students may submit the Work-Study Replacement Request [pdf] form to the Office of Financial Aid. We also welcome students to meet with their financial aid counselor at any time if they encounter financial challenges or if there are changing financial circumstances at home. Each student’s financial circumstances are different and we work individually with each student to address any changes if issues emerge.",,,,1.0

Undocumented students who have been granted DACA status at the time of admission and undocumented students who do not hold DACA status but have or will graduate from a U.S. high school and who have lived in the U.S. for an extended period of time are considered domestic students. For domestic students, Rice University practices need-blind admissions and meets the full demonstrated financial need of admitted students through a combination of scholarship awards, work study and available loans.

An affidavit is required (not for admission) to ensure that undocumented students are assessed the domestic tuition rate. This form can be accessed at www.siue.edu/undocumented. Students are encouraged to submit this completed form with their admission documents. SIUE offers in-state tuition to all domestic undergraduate students including undocumented students. The tuition rate assessed for the first semester is locked in for four years. Fees also include basic textbooks as SIUE offers a textbook rental system. Cost of attendance is available at www.siue.edu/payingforcollege.","All admission decisions for domestic students including undocumented are based solely on academic criteria (i.e. cumulative GPA). No finances are requested, reviewed, or considered.","Undocumented students can be considered for all merit based awards offered by Undergraduate Admissions. Visit www.siue.edu/scholarships for more specific information on scholarships.
Scholarships currently are available for fall entry only. December 1 is the priority deadline for freshmen and March 1 for transfer students.","No, but undocumented students can be considered for all merit based awards offered by Undergraduate Admissions.",,"Undocumented students go through the same admission process as domestic students. The only additional item that needs to be submitted is the affidavit as described above. This simply is to ensure they receive the domestic tuition rate and this can be received post admission, but we recommend submitting it with admission documents.","Our entire team serves undocumented students, so I encourage visiting our website at www.siue.edu/undergraduate/counselor/index.shtml to determine the admission counselor for the student’s school as that is the individual that they will work closely with through the enrollment process. Direct contact information for all team members is included on our website.","Reach out to us early and often with any questions that you have. We are here for you and more than happy to help in any way possible. We are part of your support system!
Our admission application for fall launches June 1 (i.e. June 1, 2021 for fall 2022), so this gives you the summer prior to your senior year to apply. For transfer students, the application goes live one year prior to the start of the semester. Apply early to ensure scholarship consideration. Our application is available online at www.siue.edu/apply.
Utilize our website designed especially for undocumented students at www.siue.edu/undocumented as this is a great resource.","Students must answer on the admission application whether they are a U.S. citizen. We do recommend specifying undocumented as that helps us know what additional items (if any) are required. For example, students that are permanent residents must provide a copy of their permanent residency card for admission. This would not apply to undocumented students, so communicating the student’s status will ensure we do not add this as a required item to their admission checklist.",Students living in Illinois can complete the Alternative Application for Illinois Financial Aid. This allows undocumented students to be reviewed for the Illinois Monetary Award Program (MAP) grant. Visit www.siue.edu/undocumented (bottom of the page).,,"As noted in the Admissions section, undocumented students can be considered for all merit based awards offered by Undergraduate Admissions. More details are available at www.siue.edu/scholarships. At the bottom of this website, there are resources that can be utilized to find additional internal and external awards.","The website (www.siue.edu/scholarships) is the best resource to reference in case any requirements change from year to year. If students meet the criteria for the Cougar Pride and Johnetta Haley Scholarships, this will be awarded at the time of admission. The Meridian Scholarship (freshmen only) is very competitive and requires a holistic review. For fall 2021, we had close to 1,200 applicants for this award. 210 were invited to interview and 20 scholarships were awarded.",The form noted above is what students must submit if they reside in Illinois.,The Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion (CSDI) is a key resource on our campus and serves as a tremendous advocate for students.

This is a new initiative and only four programs are offered in this format at this time. However, we hope to grow to include additional programs.

The questions are in different areas, such as Admissions, International Programs, Financial Aid, Student Life, Title IX, Housing and Campus Police. I can totally relate to complexities of the application process for U.S. colleges/ Universities as I was or still am an International student myself. I was 16 when I started the research on universities, the admissions, financial aid, and lot similar questions which you are asking below. Coming from a different academic background, all the information was a puzzle to me.

What we can do is, we can arrange a virtual meeting for you and possibly a workshop to assist you how to complete the application, how apply for TAFSA, Financial Aid and grants as well as answer all of your questions which you stated below. We can answer yours, your family’s questions in English, Spanish or both or check if we can host in other languages. We can arrange this meeting in less than 24 hours or the virtual meeting can be on the same day.

It is absolutely easy to answer your questions in an email. It will be a long email with multiple pages and paragraphs. Reading the answers in an email and reading the information on a website is the same. Some questions cannot be answered in one sentence with a bullet point. UHV strives in providing one-on-one attention to all of our students. This is why UHV is unique and why students selects UHV. Meeting and talking to you will give us an opportunity to meet with you and help you to navigate the complex application and possibly connect you with other DACA/ Undocumented students (with their permission) for you to ask questions yourself and build a network prior to enrolling at UHV. You can visit our Virtual Lobby online or schedule a virtual meeting, all you have to do is follow the links mentioned. If you wish to talk to an official at each of the departments which I mentioned above then let me know few dates/ and times and I can coordinate the meeting (herathl@uhv.edu). You may have many friends who are also DACA/ Undocumented students. You are welcome to invite your friends who are DACA/ Undocumented, parents and families and we can host a workshop either virtually or face-2-face. We can host the meeting in English, Spanish or both. If there are other language preferences we can check if we have faculty members to assist with other languages. We have faculty and students from Bangladesh, China, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Sierra Leon, Kenya, Japan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and many more. Before COVID, International Programs and UHV Admissions hosted numerous workshops for DACA/ Undocumented students and their families as well as mentored undocumented students for work related experience or in other words job shadow experience.

I encourage you to complete your research among other Texas institutions as well as out-of-state institutions to get a comprehensive knowledge of how the application, financial aid and student life works at U.S. colleges and institutions as well as to check the best package you can receive for your academic, and professional credentials to pursue your academic endeavors.

I am looking forward to hearing from you. Please follow the link mentioned below to visit the Virtual Zoom Lobby or to schedule a virtual or face-2-face meeting or let me know (herathl@uhv.edu) a few dates/ and times and I can schedule a meeting with other staff members for you get all of your questions answered the same time.

Students who do not hold U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status would be considered international students at Carolina. More information on the international student application process may be found at: https://admissions.unc.edu/apply/international-students/. When reviewing applications for admission, we do review need-blind.

We understand that students travel many different roads to get to Carolina, and we celebrate the variety of interests, backgrounds, and aspirations that they bring with them. At the same time, it's fair to say that we seek excellence. We focus first on academic excellence, using a variety of information-courses, grades, test scores, recommendations, essays-to help us assess performance and potential. Because of the holistic nature of our review, there is no formula for admission--no one is automatically admitted or denied because of a single number or factor. We read applications in a thoughtful manner, as we work to understand each student individually. In seeking students who will contribute to our community and benefit from the Carolina experience, we need to know much more than just grades or test scores.

We're committed to a safe and welcoming environment for students and we want to see students thrive and complete their education at Carolina.",,,,,"We are committed to access and affordability for all of our students and our tuition and fees are among the lowest in the nation. International students (those who do not hold US citizenship or permanent resident status) should understand, however, that they are not eligible to receive need-based financial aid and should be prepared to pay the full cost of attendance. We are able to consider international students for a very limited number of scholarships. There is no separate application for these scholarships as students are automatically considered when they apply. More information about the financial aid process for international students may found here https://studentaid.unc.edu/special-circumstances/international-students/.",,,,,,,,,,Thank you for your interest in learning more about Carolina. We know that students manage a lot of nuance and detail as they're applying to colleges and we want to be a resource that helps make the process more approachable. We welcome and encourage students to reach out to us directly so we can help with their specific questions.

We take tremendous pride in the stories student share with us and build our class one student at a time. While we know that we cant admit every applicant, we appreciate the diversity that every story has as we build our community. The story telling aspect of the application process can look many different ways and we want students to know that their story is theirs to share and we value the time and effort they put into the process.",Students are free to disclose their status in a way that is comfortable for them.

WUPD officers are visible, accessible and dedicated to their primary goal: making sure that every member of our community and our visitors feel safe on and around our campuses. As a matter of course, WUPD officers do not inquire about immigration status in carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities. they only will do so if related to criminal violations or threats of violent behavior. Further, WUPD does not detain individuals solely because of their immigration status. It is neither the university’s practice nor expectation that WUPD will function as an agent of the federal government in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. WUPD will of course comply with lawful subpoenas or other legal requirements.",The university will zealously protect the privacy of confidential student information and will adhere to the privacy protections granted to our students by federal law.

You can learn more at www.wku.edu/border. This is guaranteed to any student accepted to WKU regardless of documentation status.



Undocumented students apply as domestic students at WKU. We will never share their information with ICE or any immigration officials and they are not allowed on campus without a warrant. Students should answer directly on the application that they are undocumented, however it will not affect their application process at all. As long as an undocumented students meets our admission requirements they will be admitted to WKU. Students are admitted to WKU with at least a 2.5 unweighted GPA (no ACT is required for admission). If the student is between a 2.0-2.49 unweighted GPA they can be admitted but at that point their ACT score would determine their admission eligibility.



Undocumented students are eligible for our merit scholarships here at WKU. You can view a list of our merit opportunities at https://www.wku.edu/financialaid/scholarships/freshmen-2122-academicyear.php. There are no applications for the scholarships on that page (except the Cherry Presidential) and they will be applied to the students account automatically as long as they meet the minimum requirements for the awards. They are renewable and stackable. We also have a minority scholarship called the Cornelius A Martin Award that the majority of undocumented students that I work with receive. Any other questions regarding financial aid at WKU should be directed to their office at fa.help@wku.edu.



I work with undocumented quite regularly and many of those students choose to enroll at WKU for our campus community. We are a mid-sized institution that prides itself on the strong relationships between our faculty and students. They truly go above and beyond to help our students succeed, and as an institution we provide every resource possible to ensure that our students achieve their academic, career, and personal goals. WKU is located in Bowling Green which was voted the best city to live in Kentucky as well as a top college town in America. WKU is proud of our diverse student body, and our Intercultural Student Engagement Center works directly with any underrepresented student to provide them with additional academic, social, and professional support.
